Easily and securely share files and directories from the command line through
a safe, private and encrypted link using a single simple command. \
Files are shared using the Send service and may be up to 2GB. \
Others are able to download these files with this tool, \
or through their web browser.\n\
\n\
All files are always encrypted on the client, \
and secrets are never shared with the remote host. \
An optional password may be specified, and a default file lifetime of 1 \
(up to 20) download or 24 hours is enforced to ensure your stuff does not \
remain online forever. This provides a secure platform to share your files."""
